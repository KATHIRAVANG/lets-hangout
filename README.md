## Description

Bored? Want to hang out with friends, but not sure who's available? This app will connect to your favorite social network and allow you to post a hangout invitation status message. It will also collect recent status updates from all your friends looking for similar invitations, and will watch for replies to your status message so you can see who else wants to hang out right now. Once you've selected who you want to hang out with, you can post an event update with a time and place to meet.


## Basic

* Sign in with Facebook (or other social network) and post a customizable hangout invitation message.

## Mid Level

* Collect recent statuses from nearby friends and list other friends who seem may be available.
* Keep track of friends you interact and hang out with the most, and automatically suggest that you tag them in your hangout invites.

## Advanced

* Collect content you and your friends posted during your hangout sessions and turn them into a hangout gallery in the app. Make it easy to share and relive prior hangout sessions.
